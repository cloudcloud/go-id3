# go-id3
Go lib and binary for working with id3v1 and id3v2 tags.

## explanation
Whilst putting together a simple single-streaming music application, there was a need to have a simple and comprehensive tag processor. To be more cross-platform and readily available, this side-project was born to suit the purpose. A library is provided for other project usage, along with binary for specific command-line usage when required.

## requirements
```
go
```
