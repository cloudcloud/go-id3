## explanation
Whilst putting together a simple single-streaming music application, there was a need to have a simple and comprehensive tag processor. To be more cross-platform and readily available, this side-project was born to suit the purpose. A library is provided for other project usage, along with binary for specific command-line usage when required.

## requirements
```
go
```

## installation
Standard installation is simply using ``go get github.com/cloudcloud/go-id3/...`` to import the libraries and compile the binaries. Your go environment will need to be correctly configured and available for this to function correctly though.
